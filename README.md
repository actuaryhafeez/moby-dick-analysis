# Project Description: Analyzing the Text of Moby Dick
<p> In this project, we will be analyzing the text of Herman Melville's classic novel, Moby Dick. We will use natural language processing techniques to extract and count the frequency of each word in the novel, and then visualize the results in a frequency distribution plot.</p>

<p>This project will demonstrate how natural language processing skills can be applied to unstructured data, such as text. By analyzing the most frequent words in Moby Dick, we can gain insights into the themes and ideas explored in the novel, as well as the writing style of Herman Melville.</p>

Through this project, we will explore the following steps:

* Fetching the HTML file containing the text of Moby Dick from Project Gutenberg using Python's requests package.
* Using BeautifulSoup to extract the text from the HTML file.
* Tokenizing the text to remove punctuation and whitespace, and create a list of words.
* Filtering out stop words (commonly used words that do not carry much meaning) using nltk's list of English stop words.
* Counting the frequency of each word using Python's Counter class.
* Visualizing the results in a frequency distribution plot using matplotlib.
<p> This project will be implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and shared on GitHub for others to learn and build upon.</p>
